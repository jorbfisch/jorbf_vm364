Event Presentation:
I went to this event on Thursday April 14th. It was a talk given by Craig Hemdor about VR technology, 
it’s uses in and outside of gaming, as well as things to keep in mind while programming for VR. 
Craig himself is in the middle of working on designing some VR game for a company, I got there a little late because 
I couldn’t figure out how to get into the building so I didn’t hear all of that.

The talk was really small, I think there were maybe 20 people there, and it was given in Dispatch headquarters.
This specific meet-up was for people who are interested in VR and the uses of VR. It’s like an offset of the larger 
Boston VR meet-ups. 

So the presentation started out with Craig talking about the projected uses of VR over the next 4 years. 
Pretty much he was just expressing to us that there is going to be a huge market for VR games and other uses fairly soon, 
its projected to be a 40.26 billion dollar market by 2020. This is important because there are many new kinds of VR 
technologies being released, over the next four years they will become more affordable. 

He went on to explain that Unity is a great software to use while developing things for the Hollow Lens and he 
imagines it being the biggest developer for VR technologies. But then he expressed to us that if you’re looking 
to make money in VR technology do not start developing games, but rather go into development for more practical use. 
There are like flight simulators for training pilots, and simulators for training nurses and doctors, etc.
These are the more lucrative parts of the VR industry. 

He then showed us a few different types of VR technologies that are coming out in the market. Some of them that I
particularly thought were cool was the Virtuix Omni, the Perception Neuron and the Cell VR.

As he was showing us these he got into more depth about what its like to design games for VR. Particularly there are 
many things that we have to keep in mind when trying to make a game in VR that’s totally different from all other types 
of game development.  

He emphasized this idea that users are going to bring what they know about real life experiences into a game. 
So for example he told us about a game being developed, there was a detail of burgers being grilled on a grill. 
Many players who tested the game kept trying to flip the burgers. The developer didn’t add it as part of the game
because it wasn’t really related to the objectives or the path people were supposed to be following. 

Going off that he sort of details many of the problems and things we need to be aware of while developing such as the 
way human perception interactions with their expectations. He went into way more detail about the way our brains 
interact with sensory inputs and how VR technology needs to take that into consideration much more than other forms of 
games.

Something that I really took away from the whole experience was that because this is such a new media, everyone is at ground 
zero. Craig really expressed that developers and creators for VR content don’t know what they’re doing just like everyone 
else so anyone really can help and start getting involved. For the end of the meeting pretty much everyone just got to
talk on their own time about what they’re developing and how to work together.
