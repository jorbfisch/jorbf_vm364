For my research I looked up how to have a score box on screen update. First I had to make a UI and score box. 


This is the tutorial I used: it shows you how to create UI texts. It shows how to make the score update through a manager script. 
It explains how the script works connecting it to its text component. But this is a really simple script, but it 
only works with another script that updates the value. This can only be a static script if there is one player.

(apply a script that says this in it on the paintings that get peed on) 
public int scoreValue = 10;

(and them a script that says that this changes when the painting is peed on)
ScoreManager.score += scoreValue;

This particular tutorial shows how to add a script on the player. Based on a character that envelopes objects. 
Not exactly useful for our game.

This one shows you how to make pick-ups and then and utilize the GUI system (which was in the older versions of maya) 
to keep score of how many points you get from pick ups. It keeps track of the score and stores info the textfield via a 
UpdateScoreText() function.
